      <p>
        This specification defines an API that allows websites to declare
        themselves as <a>web share targets</a>, which can receive shared
        content from either the <a data-cite="!WebShare">Web Share API</a>, or
        system events (e.g., shares from native apps).
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a similar mechanism to <a data-cite=
        "HTML#dom-navigator-registerprotocolhandler"><code>navigator.registerProtocolHandler</code></a>,
        in that it works by registering the website with the user agent, to
        later be <a>invoked</a> from another site or native application via the
        user agent (possibly at the discretion of the user). The difference is
        that <a data-cite=
        "HTML#dom-navigator-registerprotocolhandler"><code>registerProtocolHandler</code></a>
        registers the handler via a programmatic API, whereas a Web Share
        Target is is declared in the <a data-cite="!appmanifest">Web App
        Manifest</a>, to be registered at a time of the user agent or user's
        choosing.

        This is an early draft of the Web Share Target spec.

      <h2>
        Prerequisites
      </h2>
      <p>
        In order to implement this API, it is REQUIRED that the user agent
        implements <a data-cite="!appmanifest">Web App Manifest</a>. This spec
        also re-uses some definitions from the <a data-cite="!WebShare">Web
        Share API</a> spec. Implementation of that spec is NOT REQUIRED to
        implement this one (but it is RECOMMENDED).
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>
        Usage Example
      </h2>
      <p>
        To register a site as a share target, a <a for=
        "WebAppManifest">share_target</a> entry is added to the <a data-cite=
        "appmanifest">Web App Manifest</a>, as shown:
      </p>
      <pre class="example json" title="manifest.webmanifest">
{
  "name": "Includinator",
  "share_target": {
    "url_template": "share.html?title={title}&amp;text={text}&amp;url={url}"
  }
}
</pre>
      <p>
        The <a for="ShareTarget">url_template</a> contains a number of
        placeholder fields that will be replaced with the shared data when the
        target is <a>invoked</a>. Once the fields are replaced, it should be a
        URL that is relative to the directory containing the manifest URL.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the purpose of this example, we assume the manifest is located at
        <code>https://example.org/includinator/manifest.webmanifest</code>.
      </p>
      <pre class="example html" title="share.html">
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;link rel="manifest" href="manifest.webmanifest"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      window.addEventListener('load', () =&gt; {
        var parsedUrl = new URL(window.location.toString());
        console.log('Title shared: ' + parsedUrl.searchParams.get('title'));
        console.log('Text shared: ' + parsedUrl.searchParams.get('text'));
        console.log('URL shared: ' + parsedUrl.searchParams.get('url'));
      });
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
      <p>
        When a share takes place, if the user selects this app as the share
        target, the user agent populates the fields of the URL template, then
        opens a new browsing context at that URL. Any missing fields are left
        empty (but note that the query parameters are not removed). For
        example, if an incoming share contains the title "My News" and the URL
        <code>http://example.com/news</code>, the user agent will open a new
        window or tab and navigate to:
      </p>
      <pre>
https://example.org/includinator/share.html?title=My%20News&amp;text=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fnews
</pre>
      <p>
        How the handler deals with the shared data is at the handler's
        discretion, and will generally depend on the type of app. Here are some
        suggestions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An email client might draft a new email, using <code>title</code>
        as the subject of an email, with <code>text</code> and <code>url</code>
        concatenated together as the body.
        </li>
        <li>A social networking app might draft a new post, ignoring
        <code>title</code>, using <code>text</code> as the body of the message
        and adding <code>url</code> as a link. If <code>text</code> is missing,
        it might use <code>url</code> in the body as well. If <code>url</code>
        is missing, it might scan <code>text</code> looking for a URL and add
        that as a link.
        </li>
        <li>A text messaging app might draft a new message, ignoring
        <code>title</code> and using <code>text</code> and <code>url</code>
        concatenated together. It might truncate the text or replace
        <code>url</code> with a short link to fit into the message size.
        </li>
      </ul>

          The <dfn>url_template</dfn> member describes which share data fields

      <h2>
        Registration of web share targets
      </h2>
      <p>
        How and when <a>web share targets</a> are "registered" is at the
        discretion of the user agent and/or the end user. In fact,
        "registration" is a user-agent-specific concept that is not formally
        defined here; user agents are NOT REQUIRED to "register" web share
        targets at all; they are only REQUIRED to provide some mechanism to
        convey shared data to a web share target of the end user's choosing.
        User agents MAY consider a web share target "registered" even if it is
        not <a data-cite="!appmanifest#dfn-install">installed</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user agent MAY automatically register all <a>web share targets</a>
        as the user visits the site, but it is RECOMMENDED that more discretion
        is applied, to avoid overwhelming the user with the choice of a large
        number of targets.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          Examples of registration strategies that user agents can employ are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Only register a web share target once it is <a data-cite=
          "appmanifest#dfn-install">installed</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Only register a web share target once the end user has used the
          site for some period of time.
          </li>
          <li>Explicitly prompt the user to register a web share target
          (perhaps using the same UI as <a data-cite=
          "HTML#dom-navigator-registerprotocolhandler"><code>navigator.registerProtocolHandler</code></a>).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        When presenting the end user with a list of <a>web share targets</a>,
        the user agent MAY use an online service which has pre-indexed
        manifests, and therefore show the user targets that they have never
        visited or explicitly registered.
      </p>
      <p class="issue" title="Explicitly registering share targets">
        We may wish to provide a method for websites to explicitly request to
        prompt the user for handler registration. This would be limited to
        prompting to register the <a for="WebAppManifest">share_target</a>
        already declared in the manifest (not dynamically creating share
        targets). For now, we have omitted such a method from the design to
        keep control in the hands of user agents. It is easier to add such a
        method later than remove it.

      <h2>
        Handling incoming shares
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <a>web share target</a> is <dfn data-lt=
        "invoke|invocation">invoked</dfn> when the end user is sharing some
        data intended for a generic application, and indicates that specific
        web share target as the receiver of the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not specified where the data comes from, or how the end user
        indicates the web share target as the receiver. However, one possible
        source is a call to <a data-cite=
        "!WebShare#dom-navigator-share"><code>navigator.share</code></a> in the
        same user agent.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          Examples of other possible sources of a <a>web share target</a>
          invocation are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>From the built-in UI of the user agent (<i>e.g.</i>, the end user
          picks "Share" from a browser's menu, to share the current page title
          as "<code>title</code>" and the current page URL as
          "<code>url</code>").
          </li>
          <li>A share action triggered from a native application (via a
          proprietary share system), followed by the end user choosing a web
          share target as the receiver.

        <h3>
          Obtaining a <code>ShareData</code>
        </h3>
        <p>
          When a <a>web share target</a> is <a>invoked</a>, the data MAY be in
          an unspecified format. The user agent MUST first convert the data
          into a <a data-cite=
          "!WebShare#dom-sharedata"><code>ShareData</code></a> dictionary, if
          it is not already, by mapping to the fields of <code>ShareData</code>
          from equivalent concepts in the host system. If the source was a call
          to <a data-cite=
          "!WebShare#dom-navigator-share"><code>navigator.share</code></a>, the
          user agent SHOULD use the <a data-cite=
          "!WebShare#dom-sharedata"><code>ShareData</code></a> argument
          unmodified (but this is not always possible, as it might have to
          round-trip through some other format in a lossy manner). The user
          agent MAY employ heuristics to map the data onto the
          <code>ShareData</code> fields as well as possible.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          For example, the host share system may not have a dedicated URL
          field, but a convention that both plain text and URLs are sometimes
          transmitted in a "text" field. This is the case on Android. The user
          agent can check whether all or part of the "text" field is a
          <a data-cite="URL#valid-url-string">valid URL string</a>, and if so,
          move that part of the "text" field to the <a data-cite=
          "!WebShare#dom-sharedata"><code>ShareData</code></a>'s <a data-cite=
          "!WebShare#dom-sharedata-url"><code>url</code></a> field.

          currently the case. If new members are added in the future that are
          <em>not</em> strings, the above algorithm will need to specify
          conversion to a string.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if an <a href=
          "https://github.com/WICG/web-share/issues/12">image</a> member is
          added, this would likely be an <a data-cite=
          "HTML#imagebitmapsource"><code>ImageBitmapSource</code></a>, which
          would be converted into a <a data-cite=
          "FileAPI#DefinitionOfScheme">Blob URL</a> before being inserted into
          the URL template.

      </div>
      <div class="issue">
        There are a number of cases where the launching algorithm can fail, due
        to an invalid <a for="ShareTarget">url_template</a>, with no
        satisfactory way to give feedback to the user or developer. Instead of
        failing these checks silently at launch time, we should specify checks
        at manifest parse time, and if the template is invalid, specify that it
        be ignored (<i>i.e.</i>, not registered) and that a <a data-cite=
        "appmanifest#dfn-issue-a-developer-warning">developer warning be
        issued</a>.

        <ul>
          <li>Can the share target URL be outside of the manifest scope? Is
          this enforced statically (before template substitution) or
          dynamically (after)?
          </li>
          <li>Need to precisely define the secure context requirement. Note
          that the <a data-cite="SECURE-CONTEXTS#secure-context">secure
          context</a> algorithm is defined over an environment settings object,
          not a URL. We need to block share targets that are specified from a
          non-secure manifest OR those final URL is non-secure.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>Invoking a <a>web share target</a> means potentially sending
        private user data to a third-party website. Implementors are to take
        every precaution that the user understands which party the data is
        being sent to (<i>e.g.</i>, communicating the web share target's
        origin), before running the <a>invocation</a> algorithm.
        </li>
        <li>Of particular concern is spoofing: a web share target presenting
        itself as a different party (by setting its name and icon accordingly).
        </li>
        <li>The spoofing risk is heightened if web share targets are chosen
        from an online index, rather than a set of targets that the end user
        has explicitly installed or registered.
        </li>
        <li>The requirement that the web share target be a <a data-cite=
        "SECURE-CONTEXTS#secure-context">secure context</a> is to prevent
        private user data from being transmitted to a party that does not
        control the origin in question, or in clear text over the network.
