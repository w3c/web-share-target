      <p>
        This specification defines an API that allows websites to declare
        themselves as <a>web share targets</a>, which can receive shared
        content from either the [[[Web-Share]]], or system events (e.g., shares
        from native apps).
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a similar mechanism to
        {{NavigatorContentUtils/registerProtocolHandler()}}, in that it works
        by registering the website with the user agent, to later be
        <a>invoked</a> from another site or native application via the user
        agent (possibly at the discretion of the user). The difference is that
        {{NavigatorContentUtils/registerProtocolHandler()}} registers the
        handler via a programmatic API, whereas a Web Share Target is declared
        in the [[[appmanifest]]], to be registered at a time of the user agent
        or user's choosing.
      </p>

        This is an early draft of the Web Share Target spec.

      <h2>
        Prerequisites
      </h2>
      <p>
        In order to implement this API, a the user agent MUST support
        [[[appmanifest]]]. This spec also re-uses some definitions from the
        [[[Web-Share]]] spec. However, support for the [[[Web-Share]]] is
        OPTIONAL.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>
        Usage Example
      </h2>
      <p>
        To register a site as a share target, a [=manifest/share_target=] entry
        is added to the [[[appmanifest]]], as shown:
      </p>
      <pre class="example json" title="manifest.webmanifest">
      {
        "name": "Includinator",
        "share_target": {
          "action": "share.html",
          "params": {
            "title": "name",
            "text": "description",
            "url": "link"
          }
        }
      }
      </pre>
      <p>
        The [=ShareTarget/params=] keys correspond to the key names in
        {{ShareData}} from [[[Web-Share]]], while the values are arbitrary
        names that will be used as query parameters when the target is
        launched.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a share takes place, if the user selects this share target, the
        user agent opens a new browsing context at the `action` URL, with query
        parameter values containing the shared data, just like an HTML form
        submission.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the purpose of this example, we assume the manifest is located at
        `https://example.org/includinator/manifest.webmanifest`.
      </p>
      <pre class="example html" title="share.html">
      &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;link rel="manifest" href="manifest.webmanifest"&gt;
      &lt;script&gt;
        window.addEventListener('load', () =&gt; {
          const parsedUrl = new URL(window.location);
          const { searchParams } = parsedUrl;
          console.log("Title shared:", searchParams.get('name'));
          console.log("Text shared:", searchParams.get('description'));
          console.log("URL shared:", searchParams.get('link'));
        });
      &lt;/script&gt;
      </pre>
      <p>
        If an incoming share contains the title "My News" and the URL
        `http://example.com/news`, the user agent will open a new window or tab
        and navigate to:
      </p>
      <pre>
https://example.org/includinator/share.html?name=My+News&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fnews
</pre>
      <p class="warning">
        U+0020 (SPACE) characters are encoded as "`+`", due to the use of
        [=`application\/x-www-form-urlencoded`=] encoding, not "`%20`" as might
        be expected. Processors must take care to decode U+002B (+) characters
        as U+0020 (SPACE), which some URL decoding libraries, including
        ECMAScript's <a data-cite=
        "ECMASCRIPT#sec-decodeuricomponent-encodeduricomponent">`decodeURIComponent`</a>
        function, may not do automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        The query parameters are populated with information from the
        {{ShareData}} being shared. If the {{ShareData}} contains no
        information for a given member, the query parameter is omitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        A share target might only be interested in a subset of the
        {{ShareData}} members. This example also shows a share target that
        receives data as a `POST` request, which should be the case if the
        request causes an immediate side effect.
      </p>
      <pre class="example json" title="manifest.webmanifest">
      {
        "name": "Bookmark",
        "share_target": {
          "action": "/bookmark",
          "method": "POST",
          "enctype": "multipart/form-data",
          "params": {
            "url": "link"
          }
        }
      }
      </pre>
      <p data-cite="service-workers-1">
        The shared information might be read by a [=service worker=], rather
        than being sent over the network to the server.
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript" title="sw.js">
        self.addEventListener("fetch", (event) =&gt; {
          if (event.request.method !== "POST") {
            event.respondWith(fetch(event.request));
            return;
          }

          const formDataPromise = event.request.formData();
          event.respondWith(
            formDataPromise.then((formData) =&gt; {
              const link = formData.get("link") || "";
              saveBookmark(link);
              return new Response(`Bookmark saved: ${link}`);
            })
          );
        });
      </pre>
      <p>
        How the handler deals with the shared data is at the handler's
        discretion, and will generally depend on the type of app. Here are some
        suggestions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An email client might draft a new email, using `title` as the
        subject of an email, with `text` and `url` concatenated together as the
        body.
        </li>
        <li>A social networking app might draft a new post, ignoring `title`,
        using `text` as the body of the message and adding `url` as a link. If
        `text` is missing, it might use `url` in the body as well. If `url` is
        missing, it might scan `text` looking for a URL and add that as a link.
        </li>
        <li>A text messaging app might draft a new message, ignoring `title`
        and using `text` and `url` concatenated together. It might truncate the
        text or replace `url` with a short link to fit into the message size.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Registration of web share targets
      </h2>
      <p>
        How and when <a>web share targets</a> are "registered" is at the
        discretion of the user agent and/or the end user. In fact,
        "registration" is a user-agent-specific concept that is not formally
        defined here; user agents are NOT REQUIRED to "register" web share
        targets at all; they are only REQUIRED to provide some mechanism to
        convey shared data to a web share target of the end user's choosing.
        User agents MAY consider a web share target "registered" even if it is
        not [=installed web application|installed=]
      </p>
      <p>
        The user agent MAY automatically register all <a>web share targets</a>
        as the user visits the site, but it is RECOMMENDED that more discretion
        is applied, to avoid overwhelming the user with the choice of a large
        number of targets.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          Examples of registration strategies that user agents can employ are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Only register a web share target once it is [=installed web
          application|installed=].
          </li>
          <li>Only register a web share target once the end user has used the
          site for some period of time.
          </li>
          <li>Explicitly prompt the user to register a web share target
          (perhaps using the same UI as
          {{NavigatorContentUtils/registerProtocolHandler()}}).
          </li>
          <li>Only register a web share target if it has a service worker.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        When presenting the end user with a list of <a>web share targets</a>,
        the user agent MAY use an online service which has pre-indexed
        manifests, and therefore show the user targets that they have never
        visited or explicitly registered.

        It is not specified where the data comes from, or how the end user
        indicates the web share target as the receiver. However, one possible
        source is a call to {{Navigator}}'s {{Navigator/share()}} method in the
        same user agent.

          Examples of other possible sources of a <a>web share target</a>
          invocation are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>From the built-in UI of the user agent (<i>e.g.</i>, the end user
          picks "Share" from a browser's menu, to share the current page title
          as "`title`" and the current page URL as "`url`").
          </li>
          <li>A share action triggered from a native application (via a
          proprietary share system), followed by the end user choosing a web
          share target as the receiver.

        <h3>
          Obtaining a `ShareData`
        </h3>
        <p>
          When a <a>web share target</a> is <a>invoked</a>, the data MAY be in
          an unspecified format. The user agent MUST first convert the data
          into a {{ShareData}} object, if it is not already, by mapping to the
          members of `ShareData` from equivalent concepts in the host system.
          If the source was a call to {{Navigator/share()}}, the user agent
          SHOULD use the {{ShareData}} argument unmodified (but this is not
          always possible, as it might have to round-trip through some other
          format in a lossy manner). The user agent MAY employ heuristics to
          map the data onto the `ShareData` fields as well as possible.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          For example, the host share system may not have a dedicated URL
          field, but a convention that both plain text and URLs are sometimes
          transmitted in a "text" field. This is the case on Android. The user
          agent can check whether all or part of the "text" field is a [=valid
          URL string=], and if so, move that part of the "text" field to the
          {{ShareData}}'s {{ShareData/url}} member.

        Security and privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Invoking a <a>web share target</a> means potentially sending
        private user data to a third-party website. Implementors are to take
        every precaution that the user understands which party the data is
        being sent to (<i>e.g.</i>, communicating the web share target's
        origin), before running the <a>invocation</a> algorithm.
        </li>
        <li>Of particular concern is spoofing: a web share target presenting
        itself as a different party (by setting its name and icon accordingly).
        </li>
        <li>The spoofing risk is heightened if web share targets are chosen
        from an online index, rather than a set of targets that the end user
        has explicitly installed or registered.
        </li>
        <li>The requirement that the web share target's origin be a
        [=potentially trustworthy origin=] is to prevent private user data from
        being transmitted to a party that does not control the origin in
        question, or in clear text over the network.
        </li>
        <li>A source site using Web Share API, and a receipient site using Web
        Share Target, could cooperate to join user ids. The source site could
        use `navigator.share(text: my_id_for_this_user)`, and the (user-chosen)
        recipient could use that information to join its own user ID with the
        source origin's user ID. Both sides of the transfer would need to write
        code to accomplish the transfer, and the user would need to pick the
        recipient.
